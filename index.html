<h3><a href="https://www.ednaexplorer.org">eDNA Explorer</a></h3>
eDNA Explorer is a web-based platform to store and analyze environmental DNA (eDNA) samples.  With eDNA Explorer we can help answer the questions, using eDNA, of what lived in a given area and what the environmental conditions were like at the time of sampling. Currently it takes in sequencing data to assign taxonomies via the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85794">Tronko pipeline</a>.  Environmental metadata is associated with samples' locations and dates using the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954124005168">TerraDactyl pipeline</a>.

<h3><a href="https://www.prosperingbackyards.com/">Prospering Backyards</a></h3>
From the site: This project is a community based initiative that is working to heal the lead-contaminated land surrounding the now-defunct Exide Industries in Vernon. This includes areas in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, Vernon, Commerce, Maywood, Huntington Park, and Bell, where thousands of families live affecting their health.

<h3><a href="https://safecast.org/">Safecast</a></h3>
Safecast was founded in the wake of the Fukushima meltdown in order to crowdsource tracking of nuclear fallout.  I was heavily active in collecting radiation data, and analyzing geospatial patterns of fallout, back in 2011 - 2013.

<h3><a href="https://www2.wipac.wisc.edu/deco/project">DECO</a></h3>
This is a collaboration I started back in 2010 to use the camera chips in Android phones to run a distributed cosmic-ray detector array.  It lives on at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

<h2>Other things which are important to me</a>

<h3><a href="https://www.crashspace.org"</a>CRASH Space</a></h3>
This is a non-profit hackerspace I've been part of since 2010.  So many projects and people in my life are connected back to this place.  It's about family.
