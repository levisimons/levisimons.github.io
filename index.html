<h3><a href="https://www.ednaexplorer.org">eDNA Explorer</a></h3>
eDNA Explorer is a web-based platform to store and analyze environmental DNA (eDNA) samples.  Currently it takes in sequencing data to assign taxonomies via the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85794">Tronko pipeline</a>.  Environmental metadata is associated with samples' locations and dates using the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954124005168">TerraDactyl pipeline</a>.

From the site: This project is a community based initiative that is working to heal the lead-contaminated land surrounding the now-defunct Exide Industries in Vernon. This includes areas in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, Vernon, Commerce, Maywood, Huntington Park, and Bell, where thousands of families live affecting their health.

This is a collaboration I started back in 2010 to use the camera chips in Android phones to run a distributed cosmic-ray detector array.  It lives on at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
